ProgrammerColorPickerApp
========================

## Overview
ProgrammerColorPickerApp is a Mac OS X desktop application for picking RGB and hexadecimal colors. It shows the appropriate code to be used in Objective-C and Swift applications. 

Really, the only reason I created this was because the eye dropper in ColorSchemer Studio is incompatible with beta version 1 of Yosemite. I'm primarily a programmer but I *do* deal a lot with color on a daily basis, so this was a serious problem. 

I wrote this program in Swift and it's shocking how new of a language it still feels in the community. Felt a little bleeding edge to be throwing search terms into Google that only yielded ~100 results.

## Usage
Probably nobody other than me is going to actually use this application, but hopefully the code base gives you something to poke at if you're interested in how to build desktop applications in Swift. Not that this code is *premier* code, but it __is__ functional.
