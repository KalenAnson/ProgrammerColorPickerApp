ProgrammerColorPickerApp
========================

Mac OS X desktop application for picking RGB and hexadecimal colors, to be used in Objective-C and Swift applications. Seriously the only reason I'm creating this is because ColorSchemer Studio crashes when I try using the eye dropper in this beta version of Yosemite.
